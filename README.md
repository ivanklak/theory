## 1. Common questions 

**Java Script** 
- programming language that allows you to implement complex features on webpage
- is single-threaded language, which means it has only one call stack is used to execute program /**any given time Js can do only one operation**/

**Stack** - is the only thread of js-code execution. Functions calls are placed on the stack and runs in reverse oreder. 

**Heap** - memory allocation. 

**Browsers/Web API`s** - API to support complex operations, and to help accessing data

For example:
```
setTimout()
setInterval()
```

**HTML** - (Hyper Text Markup Language) - markaup language that we use to structure our components. 

**CSS** - (Cascading Style Sheets) - is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content. 

**React** - is a JS library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page application. 

**Redux** - is a library used for ddata storage for any UI layout. 

- redux-thunk - middleware allows you to write action-creators that return a function instead of an action. Function takes the `dispatch` method as an argument, so that after the asynchonous operation has completed, use it to dispatch a normal synchonous action. 
- redux-saga - is a middleware-library that aims to make application side effects (asynchonous things like data fetching) - it is like a separate thread in your application that is solely responsible for side effects. 

**Jest** - library for unit-testing. In all projects where I participated, writing tests was required. So I wrote a lot of tests. 

**lifecycle methods** - can be ddefined as the series of methods that are involked in different stages of the components existanse.
